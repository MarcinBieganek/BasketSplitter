# BasketSplitter - Marcin Bieganek

I used maven to build this project.
I included some unit tests.

For split method implementation the idea is to first find the ranking of the most common delivery types (available to many items) and the find ranking to the worst products (smallest available delivery types). Then idea is to go from worst product and the best delivery type.
